这是一个flutter_kata搭建的应用例子，设计根据[dribbble上的 Natural Home](https://dribbble.com/shots/3135354-Natural-Home)来编写，没有设计原稿都是目测和自己p的一些素材，会有一点出入，这个设计糕在产品设计上没有深入考虑纯粹是展示设计而已所以不能说是完整的应用有些地方是不合理的，凑合着看吧。

This is an example of an application built by flutter_kata. The design is based on [dribbble's Natural Home](https://dribbble.com/shots/3135354-Natural-Home).
